# Freerooms Mobile Apps by DevSoc

🥾Have you ever wandered around campus, searching for an empty study room?🚪 Have you ever wanted to study somewhere other than the weird smelling ASB🏢, the loud corridors of Ainsworth 🏦 or the poorly decorated main library? 📚 If you are a director or exec, have you ever wanted to find a room for your in-person meetings or society event? Whether you're in need of a quiet study nook or a large space for your society's next big event, Freerooms has got you covered!

Freerooms is a tool designed to help UNSW students find empty rooms on campus. As a first for DevSoc, we're developing native mobile apps for iOS and Android, making Freerooms even more convenient.

🌐💡 We embrace the latest technologies to make the Freerooms mobile apps the best platform out there:
- Swift/SwiftUI (iOS)
- Kotlin/Jetpack Compose (Android)

**Both the iOS app and Android app are currently in pre-release development.**

## Plans

For 2025 we're aiming to have the following features on iOS/Android to reach parity with the web application:

- [] Check which rooms are free

- [] Sort and filter by a range of criteria

- [] See which buildings around you have free rooms on the map

- [] See the timetable for each room

- [] Quickly search for specific buildings or rooms


# Local Setup

See the [ios](ios), and [android](android) directories for instructions on setting up and running Freerooms locally.

# Our Team

We are a team that is part of CSESoc Development. See [TEAM.md](./TEAM.md) for more information on the current and previous team that contributed to the development of Freerooms.
