# Freerooms iOS Mobile App

This is the native iOS mobile client for Freerooms. Freerooms is designed to help UNSW students easily find and browse available rooms and study spaces on campus. Built with speed, simplicity, and student experience in mind.

# Planned Features

For 2025 we're aiming to have the following features on iOS to reach parity with the web application:

- [] Check which rooms are free

- [] Sort and filter by a range of criteria

- [] See which buildings around you have free rooms on the map

- [] See the timetable for each room

- [] Quickly search for specific buildings or rooms

# Linting and Formatting
This project uses [AirBnb's Swift style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/swift). SwiftLint and SwiftFormat are used to lint and format respectively, adhering to the style guide as closely as possible. After installation via Homebrew, they will run automatically on every build/

To run them manually rather than on every build/commit/push, run the following commands in the `/ios` directory:
```console
$ swiftformat .
$ swiftlint
```
